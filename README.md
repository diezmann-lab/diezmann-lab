This is the official github for the Diezmann lab at the University of Minnesota.
We develop MATLAB code for analysis of single-molecule microscopy data, with a focus on extracting and analyzing single-molecule trajectories in live cells.

As we add them, a brief description of major repositories and how to use them will be listed here. :)
